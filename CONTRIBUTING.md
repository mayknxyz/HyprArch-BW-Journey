# Contributing to HyprArch-BW-Journey

We appreciate your interest in contributing to the HyprArch-BW-Journey! This project aims to provide a clear, educational, and aesthetically pleasing guide for setting up an Arch Linux system with Hyprland and a consistent black-and-white theme. Your contributions can help make this journey even better for others.

Please take a moment to review this document before making your first contribution.

## How Can I Contribute?

There are several ways you can contribute to this project:

1.  **Reporting Issues**:
    * If you find any errors in the guides (typos, outdated commands, unclear explanations), or encounter bugs with the provided dotfiles, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.
    * Clearly describe the problem, including steps to reproduce it if applicable.
    * Provide information about your system (e.g., GPU, `archinstall` version, etc.) if it's relevant to a bug.

2.  **Suggesting Enhancements**:
    * Have an idea for a new section, a more efficient command, an alternative minimalist B&W-friendly application, or a better way to explain a concept? Open an issue to discuss it.

3.  **Submitting Pull Requests**:
    * If you have a fix for an issue, an improvement to the guides, or a refinement to the dotfiles, you are welcome to submit a Pull Request (PR).

### Guidelines for Submitting Pull Requests

* **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the `HyprArch-BW-Journey` repository to your own GitHub account.
* **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your changes based on the `main` branch. Use a descriptive branch name (e.g., `fix-typo-in-02`, `add-new-waybar-module`, `docs-clarify-nvidia`).
* **Make Your Changes**:
    * **Documentation**: Ensure your changes are clear, concise, and follow the existing writing style. If adding new steps, ensure they integrate smoothly into the existing flow.
    * **Dotfiles**: Keep changes aligned with the minimalist, black-and-white theme. Provide comments in the config files where necessary to explain your changes.
    * **New Files/Directories**: If you're adding new dotfiles or scripts, ensure they are organized logically within the `dotfiles/` or a new `scripts/` directory if appropriate.
* **Test Your Changes**: If your contribution involves code or configurations, please test them thoroughly on your system to ensure they work as expected and don't introduce regressions.
* **Commit Messages**: Write clear and concise commit messages. A good commit message explains *what* was changed and *why*.
    * Example: `feat: Add new rofi theme option` or `fix: Correct typo in 03-Hyprland-Installation.md`
* **Open a Pull Request**:
    * Once your changes are committed to your branch, push it to your forked repository.
    * Open a Pull Request from your branch to the `main` branch of the original `HyprArch-BW-Journey` repository.
    * In the PR description, clearly explain the purpose of your changes and reference any related issues.
