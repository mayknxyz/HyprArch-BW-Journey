# HyprArch-BW-Journey

### This is my Linux - Arch - Hyprland journey but it can be yours too!

---

## Welcome to HyprArch-BW-Journey!

This repository is more than just a collection of dotfiles; it's a guided, hands-on journey to building a sleek, minimalist, and highly functional **Arch Linux** setup with the dynamic **Hyprland** Wayland compositor. My personal setup is meticulously crafted with a **black and white aesthetic**, and I've documented every step so you can replicate it, customize it, and truly understand what's happening under the hood.

Whether you're new to Arch Linux, curious about Wayland, or simply looking for a clean, productive desktop environment, this journey is designed for you. We'll go from a fresh Arch install to a fully configured Hyprland desktop, exploring essential commands, configuration files, and best practices along the way.
